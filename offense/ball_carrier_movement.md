## Purpose
Guide ball carriers to maximize yards gained while avoiding defenders.

## Applicable Players
- **RB** - Primary ball carrier
- **WR1/WR2** - After catching passes
- **QB** - When scrambling

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals (Priority Order)
1. **Advance toward scoring zones** - More points for deeper advancement
2. **Target high-value areas** - Bonus points at hotspot locations
3. **Avoid neutralization** - Lost time hurts scoring potential
4. **Protect the ball** - Don't risk turnovers unnecessarily

## Movement Strategy

### Threat Assessment
When planning ball carrier movement:
- Identify nearest defenders
- Compare Speed attributes (can you outrun them?)
- Compare Strength attributes (can you break tackles?)
- Find paths with least resistance

### Path Selection
- **Direct path:** Fastest but may have more defenders
- **Perimeter path:** Wider but may have open lanes
- **Cutback:** Change direction when defenders overcommit

## Evasion Techniques

### Speed-Based Evasion
When carrier has speed advantage:
- Take angles that maximize distance from defenders
- Use diagonal movement to gain while evading
- Outrun pursuit to open field

### Agility-Based Evasion
When facing faster defenders:
- Sharp direction changes
- Cut opposite defender's momentum
- Find gaps between defenders

### Power Running
When carrier has strength advantage:
- Can accept brief contact
- Push through weaker defenders
- Short neutralization may be worth the advance

## Situational Strategies

### Open Field
- Maximize yards per movement
- Target scoring zones if reachable
- Avoid unnecessary risks

### Congested Area
- Pick through gaps
- Be patient for openings
- Accept shorter gains

### Goal Line
- Focus on reaching high-value hotspots
- Accept contact if scoring is likely
- Don't go backward trying to find better angles

### Scramble (QB)
- Weigh running gain vs. passing options
- Keep passing available if receivers are open
- Protect the ball above all

## Strategic Considerations

### Risk Tolerance
- **Conservative:** Protect ball, accept shorter gains
- **Balanced:** Take calculated risks for better positions
- **Aggressive:** Pursue hotspots despite higher tackle risk

### Time Awareness
- More time = more options
- Late play = take what you can get
- Don't waste ticks on inefficient movement
