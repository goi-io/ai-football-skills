**Category:** Defense  
**Required By:** Defensive Coach Agent

## Purpose
Position defenders to intercept passes and create turnovers for defensive scoring.

## Applicable Positions
- **S** - Safety (primary ball hawk, highest priority)
- **CB1, CB2** - Cornerbacks (coverage interceptions)
- **LB** - Linebacker (underneath route interceptions)

## Interception Value
Interceptions are highly valuable:
- Defense gains possession
- Points awarded based on interception location
- Interceptions at scoring zones award bonus points

## Interception Opportunities

### Live Ball Situations
When QB throws to an empty target cell:
- Ball becomes contestable
- Defender reaching target first can intercept
- **Hands attribute does NOT affect interception success**
- Interception chance increases when **receivers are neutralized** at the live ball

### Anticipated Throws
- Read QB's eyes/body language
- Jump routes based on timing
- Higher risk but higher reward

### Tipped Balls
- Contact with ball at line creates opportunities
- Alertness to deflected passes
- Position to recover loose balls

## Interception Strategy

### Positioning
- Be close enough to reach ball
- Understand QB's pass pattern
- Anticipate likely targets

### Timing
- Break on the ball when thrown
- Arrive at or before receiver
- Don't break too early (reveals coverage)

### Risk Assessment
- Gamble on interception vs. give up completion
- Consider game situation
- High-risk plays in desperate situations

## Key Factors

### Neutralization Advantage (Critical)
- Neutralizing a receiver **at a live ball** increases interception chance
- Neutralizing a receiver **at a direct pass target** increases interception chance
- Blocking the **QB directional throwing lane** increases interception chance

### Position Advantage
- Being closer to target helps
- Facing the ball helps
- Inside position often preferable

### Speed
- Ability to close on ball quickly
- Recover if initial position is off
- Chase down underthrown balls

## Strategic Considerations

### Ball-Hawking vs. Coverage
- Aggressive: Jump routes for interceptions
- Conservative: Stay in coverage, react to throw
- Balance based on score and situation

### Interception Scoring
- Interceptions in scoring zones give more points
- Consider positioning near high-value areas
- Don't sacrifice coverage for position

### Team Coordination
- Communicate ball location when thrown
- Support teammates going for ball
- Don't let receiver get free while hunting interception
